			<p class="intro"> <p><span>JACKSON HEIGHTS, NY —</span>A second grader at P.S. 398 in Jackson Heights brought a large knife to school earlier this month, and parents only heard about the incident from their children, according to a group of parents waiting to be let into a town hall with the principal.<p>

				<p>Parents pushed Principal Erica Ureña-Thus for answers about the Nov. 1 incident after dropping their kids off to school five days later. They said the knife incident is one of many, in a years-long battle with principal Ureña-Thus over what they described as lack of communication and a <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/09/01/jackson-heights-hector-figueroa-school/" target="_blank">well-documented hostile work environment.</a><p>
				
				<p>Ureña-Thus took over three days to formally notify parents of the knife incident, according to Rich Stein, PTA secretary.<p>
				
				<p>She said the kitchen knife was brought to school by a student to cut their lunch.<p>
				
				<p>Requests for comment went unanswered by Ureña-Thus.<p>
				
				<p>Parents are balking at that explanation.<p>
				
				<p>“Either the principal is lying to parents to cover herself or the second graders made up a story to tell parents,” Stein said.<p>
				
				<p>The Department of Education would not comment on the incident.<p>
				
				<p>At the post-drop off meeting on Nov. 6, things got tense, according to a video recorded by Rosalinda Martinez, a parent at the meeting.<p>
				
				<p>Parents can be heard in the video shouting down the principal’s explanation of the incident with calls to “resign”. Another parent can be heard calling the principal “mentirosa,”  liar in Spanish. <p>
				
				<p>Maribel, mother to a second grader, said her child went to the emergency room with panic attacks.<p>
				
				<p>“This child pulled out the knife, and showed it to my kid,” she said. “The child said he wanted to kill another student in art class.”<p>
				
				<p>Another parent expressed frustration with the school administration's lack of action.<p>
				
				<p>“My child is in tears. She tells me ‘They’re going to kill me’,” said Diana Ordoñez, whose daughter is the classmate of the cleaver-carrying child. “The principal is a liar and refuses to do anything about it,” she said in Spanish.<p>
				
				<p>Before starting the meeting she agreed to host, Ureña-Thus called the 115th Precinct for backup to handle the group of nearly 100 parents gathering outside of school. The group of parents were split into English and Spanish speakers.<p>
				
				<p>“She called the cops on us, saying she feels threatened,” Cecilia Zavala, grandmother of a child at 398, said.<p>
				
				<p>Parents accused the principal of not having the students’ best interests at heart.<p>
				
				<p>“What about my kid? She doesn’t care about the children’s safety, she only cares about what’s convenient for her,” Zavala said.<p>
				
				<p>Parents are frustrated at the “lack of transparency,” on behalf of the head of school with a penchant for frequent Instagram posts.<p>
				
				<p>At the meeting, Ureña-Thus acknowledged a breakdown in her leadership.<p>
				
				<p>“Communication needs to be strengthened in our school,” she said.<p>
